Warning: you need the Metaspex product to compile this application. Please contact us at info@metaspex.com to get access to Metaspex.

This repository contains an entire professional application counting:

- 74 fully custom web services.
- 36 messaging-related web services.
- 181 Metaspex foundation ontology web services (e.g., security-related).

For a grand total of 291 web services.

This application performs event management. The ontology deals with venues,
guests, hosts, organizers, bookings, invites and more.

Except sending texts, App notifications and sending email, the back end does
not leverage any third-party system. It is a monolith. Metaspex is capable
of producing multiple micro services from the same specification, but that
need is usually pushed to extreme needs. In this specific instance it was not
needed to do more than a simple monolith.

Once this application is compiled, the complete Nginx binary module containing
all the application, including security is less than 25 MB, which is extremely
small. It is comparable to the size of a single modern Internet HTML page.

The binary contains all the 291 web services and associated business logic.

The same binary can be deployed without recompilation on Couchbase or MongoDB.
Changing the underlying database requires only an update of the configuration
file.

The source code is made public not for compilation but to inspect the contents
of a vast Metaspex application.

The files of interest you can consult first are:

- include/events/ontology.hpp: the entire ontology of the application in a
  single file.
- include/events/payloads.hpp: the payloads (queries and replies) accepted by
  the application's web services.
- src/server/services.cpp: the description of the custom web services.
